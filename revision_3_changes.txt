Section editor comments:

I have been able to install Python 3.7.9 (by using a DMG file from the main Python website), install the required packages listed in requirements.txt and run the replication script.

>> We have operated the latest experiments with python 3.9. Therefore, although the reproducibility script seems to also work with python 3.7.9, we propose using python 3.9 (3.9.17). Please see the README.md for instructions.

* The figures produced by the script match those in the paper (but see below).
* However, there are a number of outputs that are not produced by the replication sctipt. These should be included in the replication script so that all the results included in the paper can be reproduced. Output in the paper that is not produced by the replication script includes:

  * Page 15, Section 4.2. romc.result.summary() and two print() commands.
  >> We have added romc.result.summary() at line 239 and the print commands at lines 247 - 261.

  * Page 15, Section 4.3. The code presented at the bottom of the page does not seem to match that in the replication script (it looks similar though). Please double-check this.
  >> We have updated the code at lines 311 - 320 to perfectly match the manuscript.

  * Page 21. Table 1. The contents of the table are not produced by the replication script.
  >> We have added them to the script, see lines 760-766.

* Page 14. Code 'romc.sample(n2 = n2, seed = seed)' in paper is 'romc.sample(n2 = n2)' in replication script. Should the seed be used here? This may happen in other parts of the paper and replication script. Please, double-check.
>> We have added `seed=seed` at line 225. We have double-checked that the code in the replication script matches with the snippets of the paper.

* As a general rule, the replication script should include all code and results presented in the paper. Also, the code in the paper should match that in the paper. Please, make sure that this is so.
>> We have carefully checked that every result (printed output or figure) is reproduced by the replication script.

* Page 22, Figure 5. Some of the estimates of mu and sigma produced do not match exactly the values shown in the paper. Can this be resolved (perhaps by adding a seed somewhere?).
>> We have resolved the issue, mu and sigma are updated to match the replication script.

* Page 23, Computation Details. The paper states that Python 3.9 has been used while the README.md file submitted by the authors suggests installing Python 3.7.9. Please, double-check the details of the environment in which the replication script has been run.
>> The replication script has run in Python 3.9. We have updated the installation instructions at README.md.


For facilitating the review, we add a mapping between the snippets appearing at the paper and the equivalent lines that appear at the `replication_script.py`:

Example - Training part (page 13)
Lines 211 -223

Example - Inference part (page 14)
Lines 225 - 260

Example - Evaluation part (page 15)
Lines 311 - 320

CustomOptim class (page 16)
Lines 646 - 677

Table 1 (page 21)
Lines 760 - 766
