Manuscript style comments:
-------------------------

o Code should have enough spaces to facilitate reading.  Please
include spaces before and after operators and after commas (unless
spaces have syntactical meaning).

>> We have added spaces to all before and after all operators
   inside \code{}.

--

o If using "e.g." and "i.e." add a comma after the period to keep
LaTeX from interpreting them as the end of a sentence, i.e.: "e.g., "
and "i.e., ".

>> We have update the document to follow this comment.

--

o Equations should be marked with a \label and referred to by either
  Equation~\ref{...} (with capitalization, without parentheses)
    or
  (\ref({...})
  with the former being preferred if the number of equation
  references is not too large.

>> We have used Equation~\ref{...} (with capitalization, without
   parentheses).

--

o Code should preferably be presented in the usual text flow.

>> We have updated many parts of the document to align them with this
   comment. In essence, we stop the usual text flow only for
   presenting multiline code snippets or an important function, like,

   Chapter 4.1:
     >>> romc.solve_problems()
     >>> romc.distance_hist()
     >>> romc.estimate_regions()

   Chapter 4.2:
     >>> romc.sample()

   In all other cases, we present code, i.e. functions, classes etc.,
   in the usual text flow.

--

o As a reminder, please make sure that: - \proglang, \pkg and \code
  have been used for highlighting throughout the paper (including titles
  and references), except where explicitly escaped.

>> We have aligned the document to follow this comment.


---

References:

o Please make sure that all software packages are \cite{}'d properly.

>> We have added citations everywhere.

--

o All references should be in title style.

>> We changed reference titles to title style.

--

o See FAQ for specific reference instructions.

>> We followed FAQ instructions.

--

Code:

o Please make sure that the files needed to replicate all code/examples within the manuscript are included in a standalone replication script.

>> We have checked that the code replicates the reusult presented in the paper.

--

Other changes:

>> All figures have been updated to use .pdf graphics, because the
   .tex type we used before has compatibility issues. The figures
   generated by the python code were transformed to .tex style using
   the tikzplotlib package which has compatibility issues. Therefore,
   we turned all images to .pdf graphics.

>> We have added links to five (5) online Google Colab notebooks with
   end-to-end examples on how to use the ROMC method.

>> We have made some rephrasing some parts of the manuscript; most
   changes are at Section 4.4.
