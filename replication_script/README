The directory contains:

* requirements.txt: File describing the pip dependencies for running the code
* replication_script.py: A standalone script that replicates all the examples presented in the article.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The replication script is divided in 5 parts;

* Part 1 generates the subfigures of figure 3 (the running example for understanding the implementation) and prints some statistics of the inference

* Part 2 generates some subfigures of figures 4, 5, 6. It performs inference on the example of section 5, using the gradient-based optimiser

* Part 3 generates some subfigures of figures 4, 5, 6. It performs inference on the example of section 5, using the Bayesian optimisation scheme. It also perfoms inference using Rejection sampling for comparing the results.

* Part 4 generates some subfigures of figures 5, 6. It performs inference on the example of section 5, using the Neural Network extension.

* Part 5 generates the subfigures of figure 7, for measuring/comparing the execution times

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For reproducing the results through the script, you should first

* Instal a python 3.7 version in your system
* Install all packages described in requirements.txt with command pip instal -r requirements.txt
* Install the latest version of ELFI, either thorough the provide .zip file or through the PyPI repo

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comments:

* The figures are stored in both .png and .tex. For the latter to work, apart from the python package tikzplotlib, the latest LiveTex environment must be installed. If this is not the case, you may turn savefig=False at line 20 of the replication_script.py.

* The replication_script.py takes about 30 minutes to run.
