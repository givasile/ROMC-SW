The directory contains:

* requirements.txt: File describing the pip dependencies for running the code
* replication_script.py: A standalone script that replicates all the examples presented in the pdf file
* separate_scripts: directory containing python scriptis for replicating each example separately. The final result after running each example separately, is the same as running the replication_script.py. Therefore, we provide these scripts separately only for easier navigation, since the replication_script is quite long.

For reproducing the results through the script, you must first

* Enable a python 3.7 version installed in your system
* Install all packages described in requirements.txt
* Install the latest version of ELFI, either thorough the provide .zip file or through the PyPI repo
