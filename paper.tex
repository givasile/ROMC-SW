\Abstract{
  This short article illustrates how to write a manuscript for the
  \emph{Journal of Statistical Software} (JSS) using its {\LaTeX} style files.
  Generally, we ask to follow JSS's style guide and FAQs precisely. Also,
  it is recommended to keep the {\LaTeX} code as simple as possible,
  i.e., avoid inclusion of packages/commands that are not necessary.
  For outlining the typical structure of a JSS article some brief text snippets
  are employed that have been inspired by \cite{Zeileis+Kleiber+Jackman:2008},
  discussing count data regression in \proglang{R}. Editorial comments and
  instructions are marked by vertical bars.

%% -- Introduction -------------------------------------------------------------

%% - In principle "as usual".
%% - But should typically have some discussion of both _software_ and _methods_.
%% - Use \proglang{}, \pkg{}, and \code{} markup throughout the manuscript.
%% - If such markup is in (sub)section titles, a plain text version has to be
%%   added as well.
%% - All software mentioned should be properly \cite-d.
%% - All abbreviations should be introduced.
%% - Unless the expansions of abbreviations are proper names (like "Journal
%%   of Statistical Software" above) they should be in sentence case (like
%%   "generalized linear models" below).

% \section[Introduction: Count data regression in R]{Introduction: Count data regression in \proglang{R}} \label{sec:intro}
\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}

% @Vasilis: we can work on the intro when we have the basic structure of the article in place.

% \begin{leftbar}
% The introduction is in principle ``as usual''. However, it should usually embed
% both the implemented \emph{methods} and the \emph{software} into the respective
% relevant literature. For the latter both competing and complementary software
% should be discussed (within the same software environment and beyond), bringing
% out relative (dis)advantages. All software mentioned should be properly
% \verb|\cite{}|d. (See also Appendix~\ref{app:bibtex} for more details on
% \textsc{Bib}{\TeX}.)

% For writing about software JSS requires authors to use the markup
% \verb|\proglang{}| (programming languages and large programmable systems),
% \verb|\pkg{}| (software packages), \verb|\code{}| (functions, commands,
% arguments, etc.). If there is such markup in (sub)section titles (as above), a
% plain text version has to be provided in the {\LaTeX} command as well. Below we
% also illustrate how abbrevations should be introduced and citation commands can
% be employed. See the {\LaTeX} code for more details.
% \end{leftbar}


%% -- Manuscript ---------------------------------------------------------------

%% - In principle "as usual" again.
%% - When using equations (e.g., {equation}, {eqnarray}, {align}, etc.
%%   avoid empty lines before and after the equation (which would signal a new
%%   paragraph.
%% - When describing longer chunks of code that are _not_ meant for execution
%%   (e.g., a function synopsis or list of arguments), the environment {Code}
%%   is recommended. Alternatively, a plain {verbatim} can also be used.
%%   (For executed code see the next section.)


% \begin{leftbar}
% As the synopsis above is a code listing that is not meant to be executed,
% one can use either the dedicated \verb|{Code}| environment or a simple
% \verb|{verbatim}| environment for this. Again, spaces before and after should be
% avoided.

% Finally, there might be a reference to a \verb|{table}| such as
% Table~\ref{tab:overview}. Usually, these are placed at the top of the page
% (\verb|[t!]|), centered (\verb|\centering|), with a caption below the table,
% column headers and captions in sentence style, and if possible avoiding vertical
% lines.
% \end{leftbar}

%% -- Illustrations ------------------------------------------------------------

% - Virtually all JSS manuscripts list source code along with the generated
%   output. The style files provide dedicated environments for this.
% - In R, the environments {Sinput} and {Soutput} - as produced by Sweave() or
%   or knitr using the render_sweave() hook - are used (without the need to
%   load Sweave.sty).
% - Equivalently, {CodeInput} and {CodeOutput} can be used.
% - The code input should use "the usual" command prompt in the respective
%   software system.
% - For R code, the prompt "R> " should be used with "+  " as the
%   continuation prompt.
% - Comments within the code chunks should be avoided - these should be made
%   within the regular LaTeX text.


% \begin{leftbar}
% For code input and output, the style files provide dedicated environments.
% Either the ``agnostic'' \verb|{CodeInput}| and \verb|{CodeOutput}| can be used
% or, equivalently, the environments \verb|{Sinput}| and \verb|{Soutput}| as
% produced by \fct{Sweave} or \pkg{knitr} when using the \code{render_sweave()}
% hook. Please make sure that all code is properly spaced, e.g., using
% \code{y = a + b * x} and \emph{not} \code{y=a+b*x}. Moreover, code input should
% use ``the usual'' command prompt in the respective software system. For
% \proglang{R} code, the prompt \code{"R> "} should be used with \code{"+  "} as
% the continuation prompt. Generally, comments within the code chunks should be
% avoided -- and made in the regular {\LaTeX} text instead. Finally, empty lines
% before and after code input/output should be avoided (see above).

\section{Design principles}  % better title needed

For developing an extenbable implementation of ROMC, we initially
translate ROMC's mathematic description to an algorithmic one. The
pure algorithmic view serves as the driver for designing the actual
implementation at \pkg{ELFI}.

\section{Implemented functionalities}

In this section, we present our implementation. At~\ref{subsec:ELFI}
we introduce the reader to the \proglang{Python} package \pkg{Engine
  for likelihood-free inference (ELFI)}
package. At~\ref{subsec:general_design} we explain the general design
that we follow. Then, we divide the implementation into three parts;
at~\ref{subsec:training} we present the training (fitting) part,
at~\ref{subsec:inference} the inference part and
at~\ref{subsec:evaluation} the evaluation part. Finally,
at~\ref{subsec:extensibility} we describe how a user may extend ROMC
with its custom modules.

% The results in this paper were obtained using

%% - All references should be made with \cite, \citet, \citep, \citealp etc.

% \begin{appendix}

% \section{More technical details} \label{app:technical}

% \begin{leftbar}
% Appendices can be included after the bibliography (with a page break). Each
% section within the appendix should have a proper section title (rather than
% just \emph{Appendix}).

% For more technical style details, please check out JSS's style FAQ at
% \url{https://www.jstatsoft.org/pages/view/style#frequently-asked-questions}
% which includes the following topics:
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item Title vs.\ sentence case.
%   \item Graphics formatting.
%   \item Naming conventions.
%   \item Turning JSS manuscripts into \proglang{R} package vignettes.
%   \item Trouble shooting.
%   \item Many other potentially helpful details\dots
% \end{itemize}
% \end{leftbar}


% \section[Using BibTeX]{Using \textsc{Bib}{\TeX}} \label{app:bibtex}

% \begin{leftbar}
% References need to be provided in a \textsc{Bib}{\TeX} file (\code{.bib}). All
% references should be made with \verb|\cite|, \verb|\citet|, \verb|\citep|,
% \verb|\citealp| etc.\ (and never hard-coded). This commands yield different
% formats of author-year citations and allow to include additional details (e.g.,
% pages, chapters, \dots) in brackets. In case you are not familiar with these
% commands see the JSS style FAQ for details.

% Cleaning up \textsc{Bib}{\TeX} files is a somewhat tedious task -- especially
% when acquiring the entries automatically from mixed online sources. However,
% it is important that informations are complete and presented in a consistent
% style to avoid confusions. JSS requires the following format.
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item JSS-specific markup (\verb|\proglang|, \verb|\pkg|, \verb|\code|) should
%     be used in the references.
%   \item Titles should be in title case.
%   \item Journal titles should not be abbreviated and in title case.
%   \item DOIs should be included where available.
%   \item Software should be properly cited as well. For \proglang{R} packages
%     \code{citation("pkgname")} typically provides a good starting point.
% \end{itemize}
% \end{leftbar}
