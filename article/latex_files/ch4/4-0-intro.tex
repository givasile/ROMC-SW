In this section, we present the implementation, dividing it into three
parts; at~\ref{subsec:training} we present the fitting part,
at~\ref{subsec:inference} the inference part and
at~\ref{subsec:evaluation} the evaluation part. Finally,
at~\ref{subsec:extensibility} we describe how a user may extend ROMC
with its custom modules.
